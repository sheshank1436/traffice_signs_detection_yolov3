# traffice_signs_detection_yolov3
Training YOLO v3 for Objects Detection with Custom Data.
In this project i am training YOLO v3 on traffic signs dataset.
I trained the model on google colab GPU on windows.
I first did the necessary changes to the darknet folder in my local system and then  uploaded all the files into google drive and then executed the code.
image_path_to_train_test_txt_files.py is the python file to split the input data into training and validation based on the given  split percentage.
